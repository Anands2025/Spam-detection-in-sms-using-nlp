SMS spam, including phishing, fraud, and unwanted promotions, has become a growing concern in mobile communication. The traditional keyword-based filtering techniques have proven ineffective as spammers adapt their strategies, leading to a need for more advanced solutions. This project aims to develop an SMS spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to improve detection accuracy and minimize disruptions from spam messages.
The primary objective of this project is to create a system capable of classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their linguistic and structural patterns. The methodology involves preprocessing the SMS data, which includes normalizing the text, tokenizing it, and removing stop words. Feature extraction is performed using techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec, capturing the semantic relationships of words. Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and deep learning models like LSTM and BERT are employed for classification.
Key results show that the system is able to accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate messages, with high detection accuracy while minimizing false positives and negatives. The system is scalable and can adapt to new spam patterns by enabling continuous learning and model retraining.
In conclusion, the proposed SMS spam detection system significantly improves user experience and security by effectively filtering out spam messages, making it a valuable tool for mobile communication services. The systemâ€™s adaptability ensures its long-term effectiveness in the face of evolving spam tactics.
